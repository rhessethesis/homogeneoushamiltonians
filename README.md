By defining a 2-homogeneous Hamiltonian h:IR^2\\{(0,0)} -> IR using regular expressions, we can visualise its flow, which is a canonical transformation of the punctured plane IR^2\\{(0,0)} for any time t>0. Furthermore, we graph some of its properties when represented in polar coordinates based on the results of Section 5.1 in the thesis. To look at your own example, just define a 2-homogeneous function h (see around line 55) and run the script.  

The script is based on the python script "http://www.roboticslab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/robotics_lab_animation_example.txt" for setting up the plots and the accepted answer to "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40642061/how-to-set-axis-ticks-in-multiples-of-pi-python-matplotlib" for the axis-tick-labels.
